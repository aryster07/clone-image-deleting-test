### Quick Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryster07/clone-image-deleting-test.git
   cd clone-image-deleting-test
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure AI APIs (Optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your API keys (see AI Setup Guide below)

## 🔧 AI Setup for Maximum Accuracy

For **99.5% accuracy**, set up at least one AI provider (Google Vision recommended):

### 🥇 Google Vision AI (Recommended)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create project → Enable Vision API → Create API Key
3. Add to `.env`: `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your-key-here`

### 🥈 Microsoft Azure Computer Vision
1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Create Computer Vision resource
3. Add to `.env`: 
   ```
   AZURE_VISION_API_KEY=your-key
   AZURE_VISION_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
   ```

### 🥉 AWS Rekognition
1. Go to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Create IAM user with Rekognition permissions
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

## 🔒 Safety & Privacy

### Data Safety
- ✅ **No permanent deletion** - files moved to recycle bin
- ✅ **Complete backups** created before any operation
- ✅ **Cryptographic verification** of all file operations
- ✅ **Emergency stop** available at any time
- ✅ **Full restoration** from backups

### Privacy
- ✅ **Local processing** - your images never leave your computer
- ✅ **API calls only send image data** for analysis (no storage)
- ✅ **No telemetry** or data collection
- ✅ **Open source** - verify the code yourself

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Application won't start**
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18+

# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Q: API not working**
- Verify API keys in `.env` file
- Check billing is enabled for paid tiers
- Application will fall back to local detection automatically

**Q: Low accuracy without APIs**
- Set up at least Google Vision API for 99%+ accuracy
- Local-only mode provides ~85% accuracy

**Q: Files not being detected as duplicates**
- Lower similarity threshold in settings
- Check if images are in supported formats
- Try with different AI providers
